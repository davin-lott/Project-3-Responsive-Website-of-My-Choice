ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
To be honest, I tried really hard to get things to look good,
but I just couldn't figure it out. I wanted to add a sticky feature
to the menu buttons on the side, but they wouldn't go all they way 
down, so I just laid them on top of each other for making them 
different. Overall, I can honestly say I tried my best, but I don't
know how much more I could have done without just making an entirely 
new project.

I also did change the font for this, as well as I made the buttons for my menu
rounded just a bit to make them even more different. 

Another thing I aded for this project is made the header capitalize when it switches
styles, unlike how it was before, and made the buttons lowercase, where before they 
were uppercase.

Along with the header, I added a border around the heading, just to make it more different.

Again, sorry it isn't more changed with Flex and Grid. I really tried, but I couldn't make 
it look how I wanted, or good. I did stack the buttons instead of having them next to each 
other, but that is as successful as I could make it.

                <p id="paraOne">Lorcana is a Trading Card Game (TCG) made by Disney, like Pok√©mon or Magic the Gathering. The cards are fun to 
                                trade, look at the art, and to play the game against opponents. You play with some classic characters of 
                                Disney lore, including Mickey Mouse, Cinderella, Hei Hei, Genie, and more!
                </p>
                <p id="paraTwo">Lorcana is probably my favorite table-top game, and it's a shame that more people don't know what it is. One of my
                                favorite things about it is that it is so friendly to everyone. People who might not want orcs and monsters love that 
                                that they can play with some of their favorite characters!
                </p>
                <p>There are so many other reasons to love Lorcana, but there is only so much I can describe about it. Just know it is a chill,
                    strategic game that is fun for everyone!

            <p id="additionalinfo">If you want to get into Lorcana, I would suggest starting with a starter deck, which is a 
                deck that is pre-made and usually does pretty well on its own. You can find starter decks
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/lorcana-starter-deck/s?k=lorcana+starter+deck">online</a> or 
                at board game stores.
